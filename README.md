## Problem Title
SIH 25009: Gamified Environmental Education Platform for Schools and Colleges

## Problem Creater's Organization
Department of Higher Education, Government of Punjab

## Theme
Smart Education

## Problem Description
### Problem Statement
<ul>
  <li>Despite the rising urgency of climate change and environmental degradation, environmental education remains largely theoretical in many Indian schools and colleges. Students are often taught textbook-based content with little emphasis on real-world application, local ecological issues, or personal responsibility.</li>
  <li>There is a lack of engaging tools that motivate students to adopt eco-friendly practices or understand the direct consequences of their lifestyle choices. Traditional methods fail to instill sustainable habits or inspire youth participation in local environmental efforts.</li>
</ul>

### Impact
<ul>
  <li>As future decision-makers, students must be environmentally literate and empowered to take meaningful actions. Without innovative education methods, we risk raising a generation unaware of sustainability challenges.</li>
  <li>An interactive, practical approach to environmental learning will foster long-term behavioral change, local involvement, and a ripple effect across families and communities. This aligns with India's SDG goals and NEP 2020's emphasis on experiential learning.</li>
</ul>

### Expected Outcomes
<ul>
  <li>A gamified mobile/web platform or app that teaches students about environmental issues through interactive lessons, challenges, quizzes, and real-world tasks (e.g., tree-planting, waste segregation).</li>
  <li>Tracking of eco-points, enabling school-level competitions.</li>
  <li>Rewards for sustainable practices through digital badges and recognition.</li>
</ul>

## Proposed Solution
App Name: HabitEarth

HabitEarth is a gamified environmental education platform designed to help students develop eco-friendly daily habits. The main goal of HabitEarth is to convert environmental learning from theory into practical action.

This platform provides short lessons on climate change, pollution, biodiversity, and sustainability. It conducts interactive quizzes and assigns simple daily eco-habit tasks.

The app tracks students’ performance and awards them with EcoPoints, which encourages them to stay motivated and consistent.

Students earn EcoPoints by completing tasks like:

1.Planting trees

2.Avoiding single-use plastics

3.Practicing waste segregation

4.Using reusable bottles and bags

5.Reducing plastic usage

6.Turning off unused lights

7.Participating in clean-up drives

Colleges and schools can view leaderboards and conduct competitions between classes.

The focus of HabitEarth is consistency and habit formation.

HabitEarth addresses the problem of theoretical environmental education by encouraging students to take real-life eco-friendly actions.

Instead of only studying environmental topics in textbooks, students practice sustainable habits daily. The gamified system motivates them to participate actively.

By tracking performance and rewarding, the platform builds environmental responsibility and awareness among students.

The uniqueness of HabitEarth lies in its habit-based approach rather than one-time challenges.

*Daily eco-habit tracking system

*EcoPoints reward mechanism

*Leaderboards for class-level competition

*Focus on long-term consistency

*Integration of learning + action + competition

HabitEarth promotes small daily actions that lead to long-term environmental impact.

## Technical Approach
Technologies to Use

1.Frontend:

*HTML

*CSS

*JavaScript

2.Backend:

*Django (Python framework)

3.Database:

*PostgreSQL

4.Hosting:

*Cloud platform 

Work Flow:

1.Student registers on the website

2.Completes environmental lesson

3.Takes quiz to test knowledge

4.Receives daily eco-habit task

5.Submits confirmation or proof

6.EcoPoints are added

7.Leaderboard updates automatically

## Feasibility and Viability
HabitEarth is feasible because it will be developed as a web application. Most schools and colleges already have computer labs and internet access. Students can access the platform through a browser without installing any software. The features like lessons, quizzes, eco-tasks, and leaderboards are simple and can be built step by step.

Challenges they would face are:

*Students may lose interest over time.

*Some students may submit false task updates.

*Limited internet access in some areas.

Solutions:

*Provide digital badges and recognition to keep students motivated.

*Allow teachers to verify important eco-tasks.

*Keep the website simple and easy to use.

## Impact and Benefits
Impact:

*Increases environmental awareness.

*Encourages behavioral change.

*Promotes community participation.

*Builds responsible future citizens.

Benefits:
This would help us in Social, Environmental, Economical & Educational way by creating environmentally responsible students, reduces waste and promotes sustainability, encourages efficient use of resources & supporting practical and experiential learning.
